## Student Portfolio
This page is the culmination of all the HTML/CSS learning we've done so far. It is an active portfolio for me as a developer. It's styled with CSS and contains a navbar, footer, form, video, and image containers. 

## HTML Challenges
This page is the result of a series of challenges that I chose to place upon a singular page. Styled with CSS, it contains a footer, navbar, image and video with text overlay, images with varying filters and columns, and a table.  

## The Pet Shop
This page was created to teach about linking, image and video, filter overlays, columns forms, and footers. It's been styled with CSS and contains two pages with shared styling. 

## Simple Recipes
This page we learned more complicated styling; it was intended to be a recipe-based website that shares with the community. Styled with CSS, it focuses on recipe cards that flip to reveal cooking deatils. It contains a footer, form, internal links, and columned image containers, transforming elements, and more complicated navbar. 

## One Page Website
This page was something I created to showcase the difference between different kinds of baked goods in the "cobbler" family. It's been styled with CSS and focused on topnav, footer, background image, form, and video/images.

## Album Challenege (Bootstrap)
This page was an assignment to utilize a Bootstrap template to design and display a page; I chose to make an Album about giant flightless birds. This page has no stylesheet--only Bootstrap library elements. Working with limitations in that existing framework, I learned much about using existing Bootstrap elements to help me fulfill my vision.    

## Grace Hopper Project
This page was a lesson on how to begin to make a webpage with focus on the readme and figuring out how to find what you need. Styled with CSS, it contains a header, image, links, and much text (and text formatting). 

## Academy Cinemas
This page was an example movie website that utilized Bootstrap. It contained many Bootstrap elements and custom adjustments including form, cards, drowdowns, navbar, footer and internal links.
