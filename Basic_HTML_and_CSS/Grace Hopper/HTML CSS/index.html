                        Grace Hopper (1906–1992) was a pioneering American computer scientist, mathematician, and U.S.
                        Navy rear admiral who played a key role in the early development of computer programming. She
                        worked on the Harvard Mark I during World War II and later helped create the first compiler,
                        making it possible to write programs in English-like language rather than machine code. This
                        work laid the foundation for COBOL, a major programming language used in business and
                        government. Known for her advocacy of high-level programming and computing standardization,
                        Hopper was also famous for popularizing the term “debugging.” Her legacy includes numerous
                        honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Grace Hopper Celebration, which
                        promotes women in technology.

            <p>
                Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was born in New York City in 1906 into a family that valued education and
                intellectual curiosity. From an early age, she exhibited a fascination with how things worked—famously
                dismantling several alarm clocks just to understand their mechanics. Her parents encouraged this
                curiosity, which laid the foundation for her future in mathematics and science. She attended the
                Hartridge School, and later earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and physics from Vassar College in
                1928. Grace continued her studies at Yale University, earning a master’s degree in 1930 and a Ph.D. in
                mathematics in 1934, at a time when few women pursued such advanced academic paths.
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing her doctorate, Hopper returned to Vassar as a mathematics professor, where she built a
                reputation as a gifted and rigorous teacher. Despite the stability and respectability of her academic
                career, Hopper felt called to serve when World War II began. Her intellectual discipline, coupled with
                an innate drive to contribute more tangibly to national efforts, would soon propel her out of the
                classroom and into a field that was just beginning to take shape: computing. Her story was about to
                intersect with the early days of digital technology—and she would become one of its most influential
                pioneers.

            <h3 id="career">Career</h3>
            <p>
                During World War II, Hopper joined the U.S. Navy Reserve, despite initial rejections due to age and
                weight. She completed officer training and was assigned to the Harvard Computation Lab, where she worked
                with Howard Aiken on the Harvard Mark I—an early electromechanical computer. There, she developed
                programming methods, wrote one of the first user manuals, and co-authored research papers that laid the
                groundwork for computer science as a discipline. Her role in this pioneering team placed her at the
                epicenter of early computer development. The famous incident involving a moth inside the Mark II
                machine, which she documented, helped popularize the term “debugging.”
            </p>
            <p>
                After the war, Hopper continued her trailblazing work in the private sector, joining the Eckert–Mauchly
                Computer Corporation and contributing to the development of the UNIVAC I—the first commercial computer.
                There, she created the first compiler (A-0 system), which enabled users to write instructions in
                English-like commands instead of binary code. This led to the development of FLOW-MATIC and, eventually,
                her crucial role in designing COBOL, a language that revolutionized business computing and is still used
                today. Hopper also returned to military service, where she led efforts in standardizing programming
                languages across the Navy and advocated for distributed computing—ideas that anticipated modern
                networking and cloud computing. Her rise through the ranks culminated in her becoming a rear admiral,
                one of the highest-ranking women in U.S. Navy history.

            <h3 id="retirement">Retirement</h3>
            <p>
                Hopper formally retired from the Navy at age 60, but her expertise kept her in demand. She was recalled
                to active duty several times and finally retired in 1986, at age 79, making her the oldest serving
                officer in the U.S. Navy at the time. She was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal upon
                retirement. Transitioning to the private sector once again, she joined Digital Equipment Corporation as
                a senior consultant. There, she became a sought-after speaker and mentor, known for her clarity, humor,
                and signature teaching methods—like handing out pieces of wire representing nanoseconds to explain
                computing speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her impact extended far beyond her own achievements. Hopper received over 40 honorary degrees and
                numerous national and military honors. The USS Hopper was named in her honor, as were buildings,
                institutions, and even a transatlantic data cable built by Google. Her name lives on through the Grace
                Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing—the world’s largest gathering of women technologists.
                Posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, Hopper remains a symbol of perseverance,
                intellect, and the power of challenging convention. She didn't just witness the birth of modern
                computing—she helped deliver it and ensured that it would be accessible to everyone, not just engineers
                and scientists.

                In her 1982 lecture “Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People” at the NSA, Capt. Grace
                Hopper offered a visionary look at the challenges and opportunities she foresaw in the digital age. She
                predicted explosive growth in data and emphasized the growing demand for instant access to
                information—an issue still central today. Hopper warned about increasing security vulnerabilities as
                systems became more interconnected, advocating for proactive protection of information and even
                encouraging agencies to learn from young hackers instead of simply punishing them. She championed the
                move toward distributed computing systems over centralized machines and reiterated her long-standing
                push for high-level, human-readable programming languages that would make computers more accessible.
                Above all, she emphasized the importance of investing in people—especially young innovators—by
                encouraging risk-taking, experimentation, and mentorship. The lecture, lost for decades due to outdated
                tape formats, was recovered and released by the NSA in 2024, reaffirming Hopper’s legacy as a
                forward-thinking leader in both computing and military service. <br><br>Long thought lost to time
                because it was recorded on media no longer supported by modern playback equipment, the lecture was
                recently recovered and released to the world. You can watch in two parts below.

                The Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC), hosted annually by AnitaB.org, is the world’s largest gathering of
                women and non-binary technologists, honoring the legacy of Rear Admiral Grace Hopper. While not labeled
                specifically as “Grace Hopper Day,” the multi-day event functions as a powerful tribute to her impact on
                computing, the military, and culture. GHC features keynote speeches by industry leaders, technical
                sessions, workshops, and a massive career expo where attendees connect with top tech companies.
                Signature components include Open Source Day (a collaborative hackathon, though not held every year),
                the Abie Awards recognizing women in tech leadership, and the PitcHER™ competition for female founders.
                It’s also a major recruiting ground, offering networking, mentorship, and inspiration for technologists
                at all career stages. The celebration not only reflects Hopper’s pioneering spirit but also propels her
                mission forward—making computing more accessible, inclusive, and impactful.
