# Grace Hopper dedication page project
This page is an example of a dedication site for Grace Hopper, the pioneering computer scientist and U.S. Navy veteran. 

It is intended as a lesson to show how websites can be created in real time. Also, learning how to utilize a readme.md as well as other HTML and CSS elements (internal/external links, topnav, images, header, text formatting, etc.) used in the creation of a website were also focuses.
