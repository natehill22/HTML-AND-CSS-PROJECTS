                <h3>History of Gummies</h3>
                <p>Long before modern gummies, ancient civilizations enjoyed chewy treats that served as early
                    prototypes:<br>
                    Ancient Egyptians and Romans created primitive gummy candies using fruit juices, honey, and other
                    natural binders. By the 18th century, Turkish Delight, or lokum, refined the process by using starch
                    and sugar to create a soft, jelly-like candy. In 1845, industrialist Peter Cooper patented a method
                    for producing powdered gelatin, a key ingredient that would later give gummies their firm, chewy
                    texture.<br></p>
                <p>The chewy candy we know today was perfected in Germany in the 1920s. The German confectioner Hans
                    Riegel founded the Haribo candy company in Bonn. Working out of his kitchen, he developed a chewy,
                    gelatin-based candy. Inspired by the dancing bears seen at European festivals, Riegel created the
                    first gummy bear in 1922. The original "Dancing Bears" (Tanzb√§ren) were larger and slimmer than the
                    modern version.
                    The candy's popularity grew rapidly, and by 1930, Haribo had expanded into a factory with 400
                    employees. In the 1960s, Haribo rebranded the "Dancing Bears" into the smaller, rounder, and
                    now-famous "Goldbears".<br></p>
                <p>After World War II, gummies made their way to America, with Haribo establishing its U.S. presence in
                    the 1980s.
                    In 1981, German candy maker Trolli introduced the gummy worm, creating a new iconic shape that
                    became a massive success in America. Trolli intentionally designed the "gross-looking" worms to
                    appeal to children.
                    The gummy market exploded with new variations, including sour gummies and a wide variety of shapes
                    like sharks, fruits, and rings. <br></p>
                <p>As the confectionery industry has evolved, so have gummies.
                    With the rise of dietary consciousness, many companies now offer vegan gummies that use plant-based
                    gelling agents like pectin instead of animal-based gelatin.
                    Gummy vitamins and supplements have become a popular way for children and adults to get nutrients in
                    a chewable, easy-to-take form. More recently, gourmet gummies have emerged, featuring complex
                    flavors, unique ingredients, and sophisticated designs to cater to adult palates.</p>
