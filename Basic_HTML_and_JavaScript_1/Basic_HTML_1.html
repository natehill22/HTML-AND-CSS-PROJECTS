			<font face="Arial" size="5" color="burlywood">The word <b>"armadillo"</b> comes from the Spanish word armadillo, which means <b>"little armored one"</b>. It is a diminutive of armado, meaning <b>"armored,"</b> and was given by Spanish explorers to the animals with their protective bony plates.</font>

			<font face="Impact" size="7" color="#F5DEB3">Armadillos have peg-like cheek teeth that lack enamel and <u>continuously grow throughout their lives</u>. They do not have front teeth (incisors or canines), and their teeth are used for grinding their insect-heavy diet.</font>
		</p>
		<p> 
			<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFA500">Armadillos can run <i>surprisingly</i> fast for their appearance, with some species, like the nine-banded armadillo found in the United States, reaching top speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. This speed is a primary defense mechanism for many armadillo species, rather than relying on their ability to roll into a ball.</font>
